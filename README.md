# David Singleton Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation was to work through my prework assignments so that I had as much of a headstart on the bootcamp classes as possible
- I built this project to begin learning the different coding skills I will need to the coding bootcamp.
- It solves the problem of not having previous coding experience before starting classes.
- I learned the basics of navigating the terminal and the start of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build web applications.
